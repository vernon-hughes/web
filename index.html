    <p>The violin is a stringed instrument that is accompanied with a bow. Traditionally, the violin is held in the left hand and the bow in the right, although there are now even some left-handed violins (violin in the right hand, bow in the left). The four strings, from left to right in the picture above,  are G, D, A, and E. The G string is the thickest string and produces the lowest pitch, while E is the thinnest and produces the highest. The top of the violin is called the scroll and protruding out of it are four black pegs, which can be used to tune the violin. The long black shaft is called the fingerboard and is where a violinist puts their fingers to control pitches. The closer to the scroll a finger is placed, the lower the pitch. The two curve-shaped holes in the wooden body of the violin are called f-holes. F-holes transmit vibrations from within the body to help produce the rich tone of the violin. The little chip of wood that stands up inbetween the f-holes is called the bridge, and it serves to anchor the strings  as well as transmit vibrations through the little holes in it. Below the bridge is the tailpiece, which has fine tuners that can be used to slightly adjust the pitch of the violin, as opposed to pegs which are typically used for larger adjustments. Finally, the aplty named chin rest is the large black piece on the bottom left of the body. </p>

    <ul>
    <li>Open Strings: Playing any of the four strings without placing any fingers.</li>
    <li>Positions: When one's hand is closest to the scroll it is called first position. Shifting is the process of moving one's hand to a higher position (closer to the body of the violin), in order to produce higher pitches.</li>
    <li>Dynamics: Denote the level of volume at which a note is played, which can be controlled by how hard the bow is pressed down. From loudest to softest they are fortzando, forte, mezzoforte, mezzopiano, piano, and piannissimo. Crescendo is the term for gradually playing more loudly and diminuendo is the opposite.</li>
    <li>Pizzicato: The act of plucking strings instead of playing with the bow.</li>
    <li>Vibrato: The act of producing a vibrating sound by shaking of the hand while keeping a finger in the same spot.</li>
    <li>Harmonics: A technique used to produce even higher pitches than those on the fingerboard by lightly pressing a string in certain areas or by using two fingers where one is lightly pressed higher and one is fully pressed lower.</li>

    <p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was an eighteenth century Austrian classical music composer. Widely regarded as the most famous classical composer ever, Mozart wrote pieces for the piano and string instruments. He wrote 7 violin concertos, with the 3rd and 5th being the most famous. <br>
    Johann Sebastian Bach was a German composer during the Baroque period. Along with several concertos, Bach wrote a series of sonatas and partitas for the violin, which are regarded as some of the most beautiful and difficult pieces to play. <br>
    Ludwig van Beethoven was another German composer, although he lived around a hundred years after Bach. His symphonies for orchestras are among the most well-known classical pieces in the world and he also composed some concertos just for the violin. Additionally, he became deaf as an adult but still composed some his best pieces without even being able to hear them. <br>
    Antonio Vivaldi was an Italian composer during the Baroque period. Unlike the other three mentioned above, he wrote most of his music for the violin, with other instruments meant to accompany it. His best-known work is the collection of the Four Seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.
