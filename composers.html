                Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was an eighteenth century Austrian classical music composer. Widely regarded as the most famous classical composer ever, Mozart wrote pieces for the piano and string instruments. He wrote 7 violin concertos, with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhQAtkXOK6o" target="_blank">3rd</a> being the most famous. <br>
                Johann Sebastian Bach was a German composer during the Baroque period. Along with several concertos, Bach wrote a series of sonatas and <a href="https://youtu.be/pnK6R5ej6Hg" title="A solo performance of Bach's Second Partita" target="_blank">partitas</a> for the violin, which are regarded as some of the most beautiful and difficult violin pieces to play. <br>
                Ludwig van Beethoven was another German composer, although he lived around a hundred years after Bach. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv2WJMVPQi8" title="Beethoven's Fifth Symphony" target="_blank">symphonies</a> for orchestras are among the most well-known classical pieces in the world and he also composed some concertos just for the violin. Additionally, he became deaf as an adult but still composed some his best pieces without even being able to hear them. <br>
                Antonio Vivaldi was an Italian composer during the Baroque period. Unlike the other three mentioned above, he wrote most of his music solely for the violin, with other instruments meant to accompany it. His best-known work is the collection of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRxofEmo3HA" target="_blank">Four Seasons</a>: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.
