                 The violin is a stringed instrument that is accompanied with a bow. Traditionally, the violin is held in the left hand and the bow in the right, although there are now even some left-handed violins (violin in the right hand, bow in the left). The four strings, from left to right in the picture above,  are G, D, A, and E. The G string is the thickest string and produces the lowest pitch, while E is the thinnest and produces the highest. The top of the violin is called the scroll and protruding out of it are four black pegs, which can be used to tune the violin. The long black shaft is called the finger board (or the neck) and is where a violinist puts their fingers to control pitches. The closer to the scroll a finger is placed, the lower the pitch. The two curve-shaped holes in the wooden body of the violin are called f-holes. F-holes transmit vibrations from within the body to help produce the rich tone of the violin. The little chip of wood that stands up inbetween the f-holes is called the bridge, and it serves to anchor the strings  as well as transmit vibrations through the little holes in it. Below the bridge is the tailpiece, which has fine tuners that can be used to slightly adjust the pitch of the violin, as opposed to pegs which are typically used for larger adjustments. Finally, the aplty named chin rest is the large black piece on the bottom left of the body. If you would like to learn more about the parts of a violin, visit
