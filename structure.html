                 The violin is a stringed instrument that is accompanied with a bow. Traditionally, the violin is held in the left hand and the bow in the right, although there are now even some left-handed violins (violin in the right hand, bow in the left). The four strings, from left to right in the picture to the right,  are G, D, A, and E. The G string is the thickest string and produces the lowest pitch, while E is the thinnest and produces the highest pitch. The top of the violin is called the scroll and directly under it is the pegbox which has four black pegs that can be used to tune the violin. The long black shaft is called the fingerboard. Above the body of the violin, the fingerboard is supported by the wooden neck behind it. The fingerboard is where a violinist puts their fingers to control pitches. The closer to the scroll a finger is placed, the lower the pitch. The body of the violin is characterized by two circular bouts, an upper and lower, and a thinner waist between them. The two curve-shaped holes in the waist section of the violin are called f-holes. F-holes transmit vibrations from within the body to help produce the rich tone of the violin. The little chip of wood that stands up between the f-holes is called the bridge. The bridge anchors the strings and transmits vibrations through the miniature holes in it. Below the bridge is the tailpiece, which has fine tuners that can be used to slightly adjust the pitch of the violin, as opposed to pegs which are typically used for larger adjustments. In many adult-sized violins there is only a fine tuner on the E-string. This is due to how fine tuners cause buzzing, but they are kept on the E-string since it is small and hard to tune with pegs. Finally, the aplty named chinrest is next to the tailpiece. If you would like to learn more about the parts of a violin, visit
